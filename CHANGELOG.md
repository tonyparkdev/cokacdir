# Changelog — cokacdir

## 0.4.81 — 2026-04-03

- **Very long AI responses are now sent as a file attachment** instead of flooding the chat with many consecutive messages. Responses over ~8,000 characters are delivered as a downloadable `.txt` file.
- This applies everywhere: normal responses, stopped/cancelled responses, scheduled tasks, and bot-to-bot messages.

---

## 0.4.79 — 2026-04-02

- Updated the built-in schedule documentation to be simpler and more user-friendly.

---

## 0.4.78 — 2026-04-02

- **The bot now knows how to answer "how to" questions** — built-in documentation (14 help guides) is deployed to `~/.cokacdir/docs/` on startup and the AI references them when you ask for help.
- Fixed Discord `<@ID>` mentions being passed as raw text — they are now shown as readable `@username` format.
- Removed outdated internal design documents.

---

## 0.4.77 — 2026-04-02

- **Discord bot support added.** You can now use Discord bot tokens with `--ccserver`. Token type (Telegram vs Discord) is auto-detected, or you can prefix with `discord:` explicitly.
- Telegram and Discord bots can run simultaneously in the same server.
- All existing features (AI chat, file upload, schedules, group collaboration) work on Discord.
- Co-work guidelines for multi-bot group chats can now be customized by editing `~/.cokacdir/prompt/cowork.md`.

---

## 0.4.76 — 2026-03-31

- **You can now upload videos, voice messages, audio, GIFs, and video notes** — previously only documents and photos were supported.
- **No more `/start` required** — sending a message or file automatically creates a workspace if none exists.
- New `/greeting` command to switch between a compact and full startup message.
- Files with duplicate names are automatically renamed (e.g., `file(1).txt`) instead of being overwritten.
- Files larger than 20 MB are rejected with a clear error message.
- Shell commands are now properly blocked while the AI is busy.

---

## 0.4.75 — 2026-03-29

- When the model list is too long for a Telegram message, it is now sent as a text file attachment.

---

## 0.4.74 — 2026-03-29

- Fixed unnecessary request serialization in private chats introduced in 0.4.71.

---

## 0.4.73 — 2026-03-29

- `/stop_ID` no longer sends a confusing "not found" error when the queued message was already processed.

---

## 0.4.72 — 2026-03-29

- Changed the cancel command format from `/stop ID` to `/stop_ID` so it works as a tappable link in Telegram.

---

## 0.4.71 — 2026-03-29

- **Message queue**: Messages sent while the AI is busy are now automatically queued (up to 20) and processed in order. No more "busy" rejections.
- New `/stopall` command — cancels the current AI request and clears all queued messages.
- New `/stop_ID` command — cancel a specific queued message by its ID.
- New `/queue` command — toggle queue mode on/off (on by default).

---

## 0.4.69 — 2026-03-28

- Fixed a potential deadlock when checking group chat context settings.

---

## 0.4.67 — 2026-03-26

- **Bots in group chats now see who else is in the chat**, improving multi-bot awareness.
- Bots now understand that @mentioning another bot in chat text doesn't work — they must use the `--message` command to talk to each other.
- Improved Gemini CLI output parsing for edge cases.

---

## 0.4.66 — 2026-03-25

- **OpenCode AI backend added** — you can now use any model configured in OpenCode via Telegram bot.

- Session resume now works across all four providers (Claude, Codex, Gemini, OpenCode).
- Incoming Telegram messages are now logged to `~/.cokacdir/logs/` for diagnostics.
- Bot startup now flushes any pending messages from previous runs to avoid processing stale requests.

---

## 0.4.65 — 2026-03-25

---

## 0.4.56 — 2026-03-21

---

- Bots are now instructed to keep group chat responses short and avoid repeating what others said.
- Fixed `/stop` race condition where the AI could sneak in a new request before cancellation took effect.

---
